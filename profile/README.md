## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

We are a group of 4 undergraduates working on our final year project titled as `Field Robot with Autonomous Navigation`.

### Problem Statement

The problem statement of the project, **Field Robot with Autonomous Navigation**,  can be expressed in one line as *Developing a generic field robot with autonomous navigation which operates in a semi-structured, outdoor environment*. The robot that is planned to develop will not have a specific application, and it will be a generic robot platform which can be used as a base framework to build field robots with various applications by adding additional features. 

### Main Objectives

The project **Field Robot with Autonomous Navigation**, has three main objectives to be accomplished, as listed below.

1. **Objective 1: Model a generic field robot platform suitable for research purposes** *The project will not be focusing on a specific real-world application. In contrast, the robot intends to be used for research applications such as testing algorithms related to autonomous navigation and sensor fusion.*

2. **Objective 2:  Experiment on optimal fusion of Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), Camera, Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) & Real-time Kinematic (RTK) sensors.** *Depending on the results of the literature survey that we carried out, it was was decided to use the LiDAR, Camera, IMU & RTK sensors for the robotâ€™s perception unit.*

3. **Objective 3: Demonstrate autonomous navigation in a physical environment.** *For this we will be using a suitable area of the university premises.*
